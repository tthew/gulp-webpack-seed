##Motivation

I am a big fan of gulp and sadly I did not found any gulp webpack seed project, so I made one.
This seed based on [React Infinite Scroll component](https://github.com/lapanoid/react-infinite-scroll)

##How to Use It

clone this repo

```bash
npm i
gulp
```

## Or via npm 
```bash
npm install react-infinite-scroll-webpack
```

## Or via bower
```bash
bower install react-infinite-scroll
```

to build
```bash
gulp build-all
```
you can also build prod and dev separately

```bash
gulp build-prod
gulp build-dev
```
check dist folder then

##TODO
Bump version gulp tasks for bower and npm (with publishing)
